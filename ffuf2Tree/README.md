# Goal
This tool creates a tree representation of a target's directory using Ffuf output.

# Usage
1. Run a ffuf scan on a target with the verbose flag on. Example: `ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u https://target.com/FUZZ -ic -H -rate 3 -o ffuf_output.txt -v`
2. Either output the scan directly into a file or copy and paste ffuf's findings into a file. Note: this file should only contain the actual ffuf output and not the tool's header or info table. Example of `ffuf_output.txt` format:

```

3. Copy or clone the files in this folder to your machine.
4. Change `ffuf2Tree.py` to fit your scan:
    - Line 82: add path to your ffuf file
    - Line 83: specify your target IP or domain
    - Line 85: add path to the location you would like the tree file to be created
5. Run the script: `python3 ffuf2Tree.py`
