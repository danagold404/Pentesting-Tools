# Goal
This tool creates a tree representation of a target's directory using Ffuf output In the following format:

```
|-- target.com [<HTTP_CODE>] (size: <FILE_SIZE>)
        |-- file1 [<HTTP_CODE>] (size: <FILE_SIZE>)
                |-- file1.1 [<HTTP_CODE>] (size: <FILE_SIZE>)
        |-- file2 [<HTTP_CODE>] (size: <FILE_SIZE>)
```

It also creates another file, that contains the same tree representation excluding the following:
- files (that are not folders) with http code 403
- folders with http code 403 that only contain files with http code 403
- folders with http code -1 (which means they were found by ffuf only for some file they contain), that contain only files with 403 http code

# Usage
1. Run a ffuf scan on a target with the verbose flag on. Example: `ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u https://target.com/FUZZ -ic -H -rate 3 -v -r`
2. Either output the scan directly into a file (using `>>`) or copy and paste ffuf's findings into a file. Note: this file should only contain the actual ffuf output and not the tool's header or info table. Example of `ffuf_output.txt` format:

```

[Status: 200, Size: 241, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 753ms]
| URL | https://target.com/path2

[Status: 200, Size: 241, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 753ms]
| URL | https://target.com/path3

[Status: 200, Size: 241, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 753ms]
| URL | https://target.com/path1/path1.1
```

3. Copy or clone the files in this folder to your machine.
4. Change `ffuf2Tree.py` to fit your scan:
    - Line 82: add path to your ffuf file
    - Line 83: specify your target IP or domain
    - Line 85: add path to the location you would like the tree file to be created
    - Line 88: add path to the location you would like the tree file without the 403  error codes to be created
5. Run the script: `python3 ffuf2Tree.py`
